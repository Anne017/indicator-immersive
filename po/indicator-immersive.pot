"This is a proof of concept of a new mode for the desktop environment Lomiri "
"wherein some system gestures are disabled to help the user focus on the "
"current app they're using without much distractions."
msgstr ""

#: ../qml/Main.qml:131
msgid ""
"This is specially useful for apps that require different in-app gestures "
"that could conflict with system gesture such as painting/drawing apps and "
"games."

"I call this Immersive mode because I feel like it best describes its "

msgid ""
"When Immersive mode is enabled, left and right edge gestures are disabled. "
msgstr ""

#: ../qml/Main.qml:150
msgid ""
"This means you can't swipe from the left to open the launcher or the app "
"drawer and you can't open the app spread from the right edge. "

"This is all it does at the moment but if ever this actually gets into Lomiri "
"officially, maybe some other gestures can also be disabled such as the 3-"
"finger gestures in tablets."

msgid "How does it work?"

#: ../qml/Main.qml:167
msgid ""
"Left and right edges are disabled by simply setting Lomiri's GSettings key "

"Some devices such as the Nexus 5 and Meizu MX4 has an issue wherein one edge "

"Disabling Immersive mode will reset the settings \"Edge Drag Width\" to its "
